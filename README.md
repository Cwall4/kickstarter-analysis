# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is a simple analysis of Kickstarter campaign data using Excel. Of particular interest was the "Theater" category and "Plays" subcategory. Louise wanted more information before launching a Kickstarter campaign for her own play. Success/failure rates by launch date and goal size were filtered and presented.

### Challenge
From the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet, it looks like the most likely plays to be funded were those with lower goals. The success rate is above 50% for those with goals below $20000, but drops below 50% as goal size increases above that. High-goal plays may also be difficult to predict due to small sample size.

From the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" sheet, it appears as though theater productions are similar to the general trend among Kickstarter campaigns to be more successful in the summer months. Taken as a category, more theater production campaigns succeed than fail no matter the launch month. 

To better understand Louise's market, I would consider additional filtering based on the country she plans on running the play in. The US and Great Britain may have enough observations to draw conclusions from, but most other countries would probably suffer from noise and small sample size.
